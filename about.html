            <section>
                <h3>Personal Values in Technology</h3>
                <p>My approach to development is guided by core principles that shape every project I work on:</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>Accessibility First</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Every website should be usable by people with disabilities. I design and code with screen readers, keyboard navigation, and diverse user needs in mind from the very beginning.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>Semantic Structure</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Meaningful HTML creates better user experiences for everyone. I prioritize proper document structure that serves both humans and machines effectively.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>Progressive Enhancement</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Starting with solid HTML foundations ensures content remains accessible regardless of browser capabilities or network conditions.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>Continuous Learning</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Technology evolves rapidly, and I'm committed to staying current with best practices, emerging standards, and user feedback.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>Community Impact</strong></dt>
                    <dd>I believe technology should solve real problems and create opportunities for underrepresented communities to participate in the digital economy.</dd>

                    <dt><strong>Ethical Development</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Privacy, security, and user consent are fundamental considerations in every project I undertake.</dd>
                </dl>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Inspiration and Motivation</h3>
                <p>My passion for accessible web development was sparked by volunteering at a local community center where I saw firsthand how poorly designed websites excluded people from accessing essential services.</p>

                <blockquote cite="https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities.html">
                    "Accessibility is a precondition for participation in society and the economy. It is both a human rights issue and a smart economic strategy."
                    <footer>— <cite>United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</cite></footer>
                </blockquote>

                <p>This experience reinforced my commitment to creating digital solutions that serve everyone, regardless of their abilities or circumstances.</p>
