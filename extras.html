                <h3>Personal Interests & Hobbies</h3>
                <p>My interests outside of computer science contribute to my perspective as a developer and help me stay creative and motivated.</p>

                <details>
                    <summary>Photography & Visual Storytelling</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p>I'm passionate about capturing Kenya's beautiful landscapes and urban scenes. Photography has taught me about composition, visual hierarchy, and user attention - skills that directly translate to web design.</p>

                        <p><strong>What I love about photography:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Technical precision:</strong> Similar to coding, photography requires attention to detail and technical understanding</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility perspective:</strong> I write detailed alt text for my photos, considering how to describe visual content meaningfully</li>
                            <li><strong>Cultural documentation:</strong> Capturing diverse communities helps me understand different user perspectives</li>
                            <li><strong>Visual communication:</strong> Learning to tell stories through images informs my approach to user interface design</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>My photography work emphasizes the same principles I apply to web development: accessibility, inclusivity, and meaningful representation of diverse experiences.</p>
                    </div>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Community Technology Education</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p>I volunteer with local organizations to teach basic computer skills and digital literacy to underserved communities in Nairobi. This work directly influences my commitment to accessible web development.</p>

                        <h4>Programs I'm Involved With</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Senior Digital Inclusion:</strong> Teaching elderly community members how to use smartphones and access government services online</li>
                            <li><strong>Youth Coding Workshops:</strong> Introducing high school students to programming concepts and career opportunities in tech</li>
                            <li><strong>Women in Tech Mentorship:</strong> Supporting female students pursuing <abbr title="Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics">STEM</abbr> education</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility Awareness:</strong> Educating local businesses about making their digital presence more inclusive</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>These experiences have shown me firsthand how poor website design can exclude people from accessing essential services, reinforcing my commitment to universal design principles.</p>

                    <summary>Language Learning & Cultural Exchange</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p>I'm currently improving my Swahili fluency and learning basic French. Language learning has taught me about diverse communication patterns and cultural contexts that inform inclusive design.</p>

                        <p><strong>How language learning connects to web development:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Internationalization awareness:</strong> Understanding how different languages affect layout and user experience</li>
                            <li><strong>Cultural sensitivity:</strong> Learning about diverse communication styles and visual preferences</li>
                            <li><strong>Accessibility considerations:</strong> Understanding how screen readers handle different languages and scripts</li>
                            <li><strong>Content strategy:</strong> Appreciating the importance of clear, simple language for global audiences</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This linguistic perspective helps me create more inclusive digital experiences that work across cultural and linguistic boundaries.</p>
                    </div>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>Outdoor Activities & Nature Connection</summary>
                    <div>
                        <p>Kenya's incredible natural beauty provides endless opportunities for hiking, nature walks, and outdoor exploration. These activities help me maintain mental clarity and creative energy for problem-solving.</p>

                        <p><strong>Favorite outdoor activities:</strong></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Weekend hiking:</strong> Exploring the Ngong Hills, Mount Kenya region, and local nature trails</li>
                            <li><strong>Urban photography walks:</strong> Discovering interesting architecture and street scenes in Nairobi</li>
                            <li><strong>Community gardening:</strong> Participating in local urban agriculture initiatives</li>
                            <li><strong>Beach visits:</strong> Occasional trips to the Kenyan coast for relaxation and inspiration</li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>These outdoor experiences provide perspective and remind me that technology should serve human needs and connect us with the natural world, not isolate us from it.</p>

                <h3>Personal Philosophy & Values</h3>
                <p>My approach to life and learning is shaped by experiences that extend far beyond the classroom or computer screen.</p>

                <h4>Core Values in Action</h4>
                <p>Daily practices that reflect my personal philosophy:</p>

                <h5>Continuous Learning</h5>
                <p>Every day offers opportunities to learn something new. Yesterday I discovered: <mark>CSS Grid has amazing accessibility features when used with semantic HTML</mark>.</p>
                <p>Favorite learning resources: I regularly use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> to bookmark interesting articles and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to open new research tabs.</p>
                <p>Code snippet I learned recently: <code>aria-label="Skip to main content"</code> provides better screen reader context than generic link text.</p>

                <h5>Community Connection</h5>
                <p>Technology feedback I recently received: <samp>Your accessibility improvements increased our site usage by 40% among users with disabilities.</samp></p>
                <p>Organizations I support: <abbr title="Kenya Association of Software Developers">KASD</abbr> and local digital literacy nonprofits.</p>

                <h5>Cultural Appreciation</h5>
                <blockquote cite="https://www.unesco.org/en/cultural-diversity">
                    "Cultural diversity is a driving force of development, not only with respect to economic growth, but also as a means of leading a more fulfilling intellectual, emotional, moral and spiritual life."

                <h3>What Drives Me Forward</h3>
                <p>My motivation comes from seeing technology's potential to create positive change in communities that have historically been excluded from digital opportunities.</p>

                    <main>
                        <p><strong>My commitment:</strong> To use technology as a bridge, not a barrier, connecting people to opportunities and information regardless of their abilities, economic status, or cultural background.</p>

                        <p>Every line of code I write, every person I teach, and every project I complete is guided by this principle. Technology should serve humanity's diverse needs, not the other way around.</p>

                        <p><strong>This means:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Always considering accessibility from the beginning, not as an afterthought</li>
                            <li>Creating content that works across different languages, cultures, and contexts</li>
                            <li>Sharing knowledge freely and mentoring others who want to join the tech community</li>
                            <li>Building bridges between traditional communities and digital opportunities</li>
                        </ul>
